## The challenge
Kamworks is a Dutch company, based in Camdodia, specializing on solar powered solutions. Kamworks asked us – a team of four MSC. students of Product Design at TUDelft- to design a solar-powered lantern to serve the 70+ percent of Cambodians that have no access to the power grid.

## The process
We lived and worked on sight with the team for three months, where we had the chance to experience first hand what does living off the grid really mean.

Traditionally, after dark, kerosene lamps are used for tasks like cooking, eating and reading, but these lamps are highly dangerous (as most of these homes are made from wood and straw), unhealthy (smoke and soot) and also contribute to the greenhouse effect.

To understand the people's needs and wants we engaged them in a participatory design process; getting insights about their daily activities, their income, and frequent feedback on the prototypes.

## The Result
The result was “MoonLight” or else Ampul Preahchan in Khmer. A solar lantern that can be rented for less than $0.08/day, the same as the average daily expenditure on kerosene.
