## The challenge

[SMart][1] provides professionals across Europe with services that simplify contract drafting and business management. The SMart team asked us to rework its country-based portals. The core foundation had to be reusable yet modular enough for each SMart entity to customize it based on its specific culture and needs. For instance, some countries’ portals were quite extensive while others were much smaller.

## Our approach

We started out by prototyping a very modular platform. Each country had to be able to use the elements it needed while discarding others. Once the prototypes were tested and approved, we developed visual elements based on SMart’s general brand and left room for local entities to add their own personalities. We then trained SMart’s team members to keep expanding the portals by giving them a design guide.
