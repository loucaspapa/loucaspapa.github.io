## The challenge
Sony introduced a new visual language for its marketing pages, and we had to go through a total overhaul of the e-commerce experience, adapting the new designs…

## The process
In collaboration with my team at Namahn and Sony's UX expert we worked to tackle the recurring design challenges. Sometimes we started from a blanc canvas, drawing the user-flows, and high level wireframes, before we jump into Axure. Sometimes we had to start working in the nitty-gritty details, firing up Axure all the way through. We evaluated the launched designs with extensive usability tests, and iterated.
