This is my new personal website.
A website built with Jekyll (thanks [Jerome][1] for the great [documentation][2]), SASS, Flexbox, Git, and the whole shebang of latest front-end practices that I've been trying to learn during my free time.
Not that this makes me a front-end developer, far from it. David and Geoff my colleagues are way better in writing good and clean HTML, CSS and Javascript than me. But it does help me to understand better the medium I'm designing for, have more productive conversations with my colleagues and other front-end developers, and satisfies my genuine curiosity to learn new things.
