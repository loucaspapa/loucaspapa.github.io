I"Â<p>Itâ€™s been one year since I joined <a href="http://central.team/" title="Central">Central</a>; the design team I work with. One beautiful year with people with whom I love to grab my first cup of coffee, argue about design, have endless conversations about food and beer, and design products weâ€™re proud to put into the world.</p>

<p>It wouldnâ€™t have been possible to meet Geoffroy, Quentin, Sarah, David, Pascal, Valentin, Pierre, Romain and Jonathan if I hadnâ€™t shout out loud on my website who I am and what I believe in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œHi, Iâ€™m Loucas Papantoniou, aka loucaspapa. I am a UX designer; not a rockstar, a unicorn, a ninja or a magician. Design is for me the process of making sense of complex stuff that we donâ€™t understand. There is too much clutter and bullshit in the world, so lets avoid littering it with more by designing meaningful products and experiences.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A paragraph inspired by Brad Frostâ€™s talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/63437853" title="Death to Bullshit talk">Death to Bullshit</a> at Creative Mornings and Victor Papanekâ€™s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0897331532/wwwaustinkleo-20/" title="Design for the Real World">Design For The Real World</a>. And while I hate this clichÃ© expression by Paulo Coelho I feel itâ€™s true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAnd, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shouting out loud who I am got me to meet Geoffroy, founder of Central. Our distaste for bullshit and our common understanding of design brought us to work together. Since then â€œNo bullshitâ€ has become one of our six principles at Central. We have developed a sixth sense for bullshit. We scan our clientâ€™s website for bullshit and remove it, give each other heads up when we bullshit, and censor our designs against bullshit.</p>

<p>In the end, shouting out loud who I am made me the designer I want to be. So, what are you waiting for? Shout it out loud!</p>
