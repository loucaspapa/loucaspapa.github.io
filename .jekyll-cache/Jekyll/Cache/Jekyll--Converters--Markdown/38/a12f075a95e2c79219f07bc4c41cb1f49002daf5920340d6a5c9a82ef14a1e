<p><a href="http://smartbe.be/fr/" title="Smart be">SMart</a> provides professionals across Europe with services that simplify contract drafting and business management. The SMart team asked us to think beyond it’s core business and conceptualize new services that could service its community. We worked on two main concepts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Agora, an online platform for SMart members to meet, exchange ideas and collaborate.</li>
  <li>Jobs, a jobs marketplace fostering professional mobility across Europe.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>As this project has been unfortunately on hold from SMart for reasons that don’t have to do with the quality of our work, I cannot share end results, but only a few snapshots from our process.</p>
