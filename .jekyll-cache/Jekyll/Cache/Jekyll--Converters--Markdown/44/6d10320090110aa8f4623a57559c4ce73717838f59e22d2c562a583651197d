Hi! Iâ€™m Loucas Papantoniou, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/loucaspapa" title="loucaspapa twitter account">loucaspapa</a>.</p>

<p>I am a product designer at <a href="https://www.rydoo.com/en" title="Rydoo website">Rydoo</a>; an application helping companies manage their trips
and expenses more efficiently.</p>

<p>Jack of all trades, running the gamut of UX design responsibilities. Floating between high-level and in-the-weeds work and working with different disciplines, I like to serve as the glue that helps build sturdier projects.</p>

<p>Designer, biker, climber, runner, yogi, bread-making apprentice, cook and avid reader are all costumes I wear sometimes during the day.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:loucaspapa@gmail.com" title="contact me">get in touch</a> if you pass by Brussels and want to have a coffee, or simply want to shoot a question.</p>
