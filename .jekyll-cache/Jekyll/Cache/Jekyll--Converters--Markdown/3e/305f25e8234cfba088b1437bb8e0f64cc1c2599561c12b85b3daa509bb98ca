<p>What happens right after sign-up makes or breaks any web product. This is why, <a href="https://www.proxyclick.com/" title="Proxyclick">Proxyclick</a> asked us: <strong>â€œHow might we increase the likelihood that new users will successfully adopt their product?â€™</strong></p>

<p>Proxyclickâ€™s customers can try the product for 30 days before deciding whether they want to pay for it or not. To increase conversion, Proxyclick needed to convince users of its solution as soon at they tried it.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-hire-proxyclick">Why do people hire Proxyclick?</h2>

<p>You donâ€™t get a second chance to make a first impression. This is why together with Proxyclickâ€™s team we tried to nail-down the â€œjob storiesâ€. We asked ourselves why someone would hire Proxyclick to manage the companyâ€™s visitors? What is the situation they donâ€™t want to be anymore? What is the burning motivation thatâ€™s driving them to adopt a new way of doing things? We got these answers from  phone interviews with new Proxyclick users, who had recent the experience of researching for a way to manage the companyâ€™s visitors.</p>

<p>The result is a series of screens after sign-up that welcome and guide new users, while introducing them great product features that will be decisive for sticking with Proxyclick.</p>
