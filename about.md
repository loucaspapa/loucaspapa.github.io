Hi! I'm Loucas Papantoniou, aka [loucaspapa][2].

I live and work in Brussels, Belgium, for [Central][2]; a close-knit, experienced, and multi-disciplinary team passionate about design.

Jack of all trades, running the gamut of UX design responsibilities. Floating between high-level and in-the-weeds work and working with different disciplines, I like to serve as the glue that helps build sturdier projects.

Designer, biker, climber, runner, yogi, bread-making apprentice, cook and avid reader are all costumes I sometimes wear during the day.

Feel free to [get in touch][4] if you pass by Brussels and want to have a coffee, or simply want to shoot a question.
