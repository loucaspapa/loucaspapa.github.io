## The challenge

Debating Europe is a platform where citizens can debate the issues they care about with European politicians and experts. Originally, a traditional blog was set up to bootstrap the project. Once the platform took off, the curators decided to optimize the user experience and increase participation in the  debates. That’s when they came to Central for help.

## Our approach

We first explored what an online debating platform could be through a prototype. We improved the way debates were organized and featured on the platform. We also optimized readability and usability and added tools specific to debaters’ needs. The end result increased the number of views and user interaction on the platform.
