## The challenge
Good interaction design is about understanding the context of each user scenario and presenting to the user the most useful options. This is what we tried to do within ASTUTE – a consortium project  of 25 partners in seven countries – exploring proactive multi-modal Human-Machine Interface.

A proactive multi-modal Human-Machine Interface should be able to understand the situation, and adapt to the context and user state—or even the user’s intentions. Such an HMI would, for example, reduce the amount of information presented to the user when under stress, or choose the appropriate modality for input or output depending upon the context. The HMI could allow voice input if the user cannot use his or her hands as in the case of fire fighters or drivers, use voice instructions if the user cannot see the interface, or even make use vibrations for alarms.

## The process
I worked 6 months for this project, while working at Namahn. In particular, I worked on two proofs of concept; one in the area of emergency dispatching and one in the area of manufacturing process management. For the emergency dispatching concept, the focus was on a system for fire brigades during an emergency response situation.

When I started working on the project, my colleagues had already done intensive field studies, developed user scenarios, personas, and a storyboard illustrating user interactions with the technology. I worked on the prototypes for the emergency dispatching team and the manufacturing process management.  

At the same time, I worked on identifying design patterns, that could be applied in other domains.

## The Result
Together with the ASTUTE partners, we produced actual prototypes of the systems. An on-sleeve Android phone for fire fighters, an Android tablet computer for commanders and a computer for the crisis team.  Overall, the ASTUTE project has provided an invaluable opportunity for learning.
